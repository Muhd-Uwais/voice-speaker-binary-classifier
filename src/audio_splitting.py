# Voice Speaker Recognition - Audio Processing Module
"""
This module handles the preprocessing of audio files for speaker recognition.
It splits long recordings into smaller chunks to prepare data for training a binary
CNN model that distinguishes between different speakers.

Note:
After the chunking process is complete, move all generated WAV files from the chunk output
folders into their respective root speaker directories (speaker0 and speaker1).
Then, delete the original non-chunked audio files to maintain a consistent dataset
structure for subsequent processing steps.
